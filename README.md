# Price-Prediction-Analytics
Streamlined three sets of big data (10GB): NYC 311 Data, NYC Restaurant Inspection Data, NYC Rolling Sales Data. Our goal is to see if there is a correlation between the number of complains per Borough,  and the average restaurant inspection rating and the price of sales per unit for NYC housing base on the different locations of these data.
